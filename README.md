# BLOG - ENGINE
The CMS is just really changed. I implemented Slim - PHP Micro-Framework and that's why it looks brightly (the code of it) and simple to learn, use. I hadn't added anything new, just re-made the CMS with Slim to make it understandable for you. If anyone will use, contribute, or just write some issues, ideas, I'll try more to add something interesting, new, useful to the CMS. So get started!

## GET STARTED
Open your terminal, or whatever you use for the git, and just:
```BASH
git clone https://github.com/mrcat323/blog-engine
```
### Install dependencies
To install dependencies, you should probably try **composer**, so just say:
```BASH
composer install
```

### RUN
Just run by saying:
```BASH
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t src/public
```
